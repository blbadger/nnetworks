# neural-network

A collection of neural networks for image classification.

cNN design was inspired by the official Tensorflow Keras introduction (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) and load image (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images?hl=TR) tutorial. 

Contains a collection of snippets (NN_prep_snippets) to prepare test and training image datasets for a convolutional neural network (Deep_network) built with a Keras API (both sequential and functional models are presented) on a Tensorflow backend.

See 'connected' for fully-connected neural networks built from scratch that classify MNIST handwritten digit images.  

Deep_network architecture:

which accurately predicts cell genotype based on fluorescent microscopic images
