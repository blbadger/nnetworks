# nnetworks

Deep learning models for classification, generation, attribution, and more. The base folder has a collection of models for computer vision: cNNs for image classification, image saliency, deep dream-style image generation via input modification, generative adversarial networks, adversarial examples, and more. 

Sneak peeks:
